                <p>
                    Three user personas were created based on early research and user interviews with candidates who fit
                    the
                    criteria. This process helped define the problems that needed solutions within other baking apps.

                <p>Jobs to be done was identified and then an MVP document was created. The purpose of the MVP was to
                    identify up to five key features of the app. The user flow was then the final touch in mapping out
                    what
                    the first iteration would like. </p>

                <p>
                    A crazy 8 process was used to draw out the first round of screens on paper. This allowed for quicker
                    development. as first round of user testing was going to be on these paper prototypes.

                <h3>Mood Board</h3>
                <p>
                    To stay within a certain visual direction, a mood board was created to set the tone and feel of the
                    app
                    before laying out a style guide. At this point in the process, the user flow and features of the app
                    was
                    pretty set in stone. So the next step was to figure out what the style guide would look like before
                    moving into mid-fidelity and final prototypes.

            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p>Quicksand is the primary font used for copy text and logo. PT Sans is the secondary text that is only
                used
                for the headers.</p>
            <h3>Images</h3>
            <p>Images must be high-quality and focused on the dessert with no other distractions within the photo. It's
                important for the user to see a close up detail of what the product should look like once it's made.

            <p>Remember earlier when I said the user flow of the app was set in stone? Well, that was before feedback
                was
                received from other designers after a second round of user testing with high-fidelity prototypes. The
                feedback was that while there's nothing wrong with bottom navigation, it doesn't really make sense for a
                responsive web app. So, a menu icon in the top header was implemented instead. </p>

                    Future iterations would include sharing options, message options to send creators a personal
                    message, and a version of the app for creators only that allows them to upload recipes and keep in
                    contact with the bakery bites team for questions and concerns.
